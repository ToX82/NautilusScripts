# NautilusScripts
A small collection of (hopefully) useful Nautilus Scripts

Pick what you need, do what you want :)

### If you want to use one or more of my scripts
Just save its file into
`~/local/share/nautilus/scripts`. That's it, nautilus will see it immediately and you will be able to right-click on a file and see it in the "Script" section.

### They are not perfect (at all)
Please note that programming bash scripts is not my main occupation, it is something that I do only when I really need, so they are probably ugly, dirty and full of bugs. If you can, please feel free to fork and pull request me with your modifications. I'll be glad to release a better version.
